Everything about aerodynamics

This repository contains all my aerodynamics homework.
It is not huge enough right now, but I hope it will grow!

This project consists of files:
- flow - contains methods to create simple and combined flows;
- figure - contains methods to create figures;
- plot - contains methods to plot flows and figures;
- circulation - contains method to calculate circulation of a given flow and figure;
- source_panel_method - contains method to calculate flow over the circular body;
- test - contains example of how it can work.

Main idea of physics that lies inside the formulas in this file was taken from Anderson.
(https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Aerodynamics-John-Anderson-Jr/dp/0073398101)

Main idea of realisation was taken from awesome youtuber Josh The Engineer.
His website: http://www.joshtheengineer.com/
His explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8EnhiSjL3o&t=492s

My contribution is to rewrite Josh's code in a more comprehensive way,
in a more python-way.

I have tried to describe all classes inside every file,
so if you are interested in it, you will find more
detailed explanation inside every file.

I have failed with source panel method,
I thought I would do it for every figure but on the present I didn't.
